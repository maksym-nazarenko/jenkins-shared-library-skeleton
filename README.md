# Jenkins shared library skeleton

This skeleton is a simple quick start point for Jenkins shared library written in Groovy.

Writing libraries without auto completion and observability on types from Jenkins core code is pretty tedious,
unless you are a Guru in this field.

When using this skeleton, it is much easier to use full power of your Java IDE to write clear code for your pipelines.


## Quick start

## Starting from scratch (Option #1)
1. Clone this repo
2. Open your Java/Groovy IDE and import the project as `Gradle` project

## Integrate into existing source code (Option #2)
1. Copy `build.gradle` file into your project (or merge it in if you already have own `build.gradle`)
2. Reimport changes from updated  `build.gradle` (depends on your IDE)


# Unit tests support


## Classes in `src` folder
TBD


## Global directives in `vars` folder
TBD


## Using mocks for pipelines
TBD
